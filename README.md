Ohaiyo! this is Derek circa 2021, I'm 16 years old as of now. I am a student at UW and most of my projects are just small programs I made for practice and messing around. 
I specialize in network security and data science/machine learning primarily in python and R. I am also a full stack developer and I enjoy building websites and communication networks.
