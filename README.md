Yo this is Derek circa 2021. I am a student at UW and most of my projects are just small programs I made for practice and messing around. 
I just like learning and posting some code. 
I want to work on robotics, artificial intelligence, and genetic engineering. Maybe even become an astronaut some day.
I like Faust and Frankenstien, they are cool people.
Go read Horimiya and Tokyo Ghoul.
