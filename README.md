Ohaiyo! this is Derek circa 2021, I'm 16 years old as of now. I am a student at UW and most of my projects are just small programs I made for practice and messing around. 
I like learning and writing short stories along with reading essays, textbooks, novels, and manga! 
I want to work on robotics, artificial intelligence, and genetic engineering. Maybe even become an astronaut some day.
