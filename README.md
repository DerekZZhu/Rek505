Ohaiyo! this is Derek circa 2021, I'm 16 years old as of now. I am a student at UW and most of my projects are just small programs I made for practice and messing around. 
I specialize in network security and data science/machine learning primarily in python, R, and C. I am also a full stack developer and I enjoy building websites and communication networks. 
Currently I am working on personal AI integration projects in the fields of network security and biology dubbed "Sephira".
