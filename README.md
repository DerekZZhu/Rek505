Ohaiyo! this is Derek circa 2021, I'm 16 years old as of now. I am a student at UW and most of my projects are just small programs I made for practice and messing around. 
I like learning and writing short stories along with reading essays, textbooks, novels, and manga! 
I want to work on robotics, artificial intelligence, and genetic engineering. Maybe even become an astronaut some day.
My favorite books are Faust, Frankenstien, Dune, Catch 22, and Feed.
Go read Horimiya and Tokyo Ghoul, they are some top notch manga kya~.
